## Overview

Wikis are crowdsourced, collaborative repositories of human knowledge. To better ensure the persistent availability of wiki platforms for the foreseeable future, decentralization of their data storage is necessary. To that end, we are developing a wiki platform that uses IPFS/Filecoin as the data storage layer, allowing for decentralized wiki infrastructure. 

This project is building a wiki for the purpose of storing human engineering knowledge in the form of a tech tree. Using this codebase, new wiki developers can easily create their own decentralized wiki, and existing wiki maintainers can port their file storage layer over to IPFS/Filecoin. Decentralization is the future of crowdsourced internet works like wikis, and this project aims to accelerate its mass adoption.
